Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tudor and I'm a 20-year-old finance student. I'm looking to create efficient, scalable systems in the finance world using what I consider to be my learned skills throughout high-school and college, such as:
  - economics;
  - various areas of finance;
  - little bit of knowledge on banking (still working on that);
  - programming, which I did for almost 3 years before becoming interested in this domain. I see this as a powerful, handy tool I can leverage in my journey.
